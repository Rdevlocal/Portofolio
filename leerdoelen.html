              <p class='description'> In this project, you learn to visually represent a brand. you experiment with stylescapes, deliver a brand guide and write a content strategy. For this content strategy you develop marketing means. It is important to create a distinctive identity that fits the brand's mission and vision and is appealing to the target audience. Clients are artists, athletes or start-ups. A precondition is that there are little communication means (logo, corporate identity, photography).</p>

              <p class='description'> In this project, you work work on a media campaign. The client indicates what the goal of the campaign should be, e.g. awareness, sales, change in behavior. Your goal is to properly research the intended target group and how to involve them. Then create a campaign that is obviously appropriate to the intended brand and has been well thought out. Clients are existing brands whose identity is fixed. It is important that you not only work out a campaign, but also develop interactive means to support the campaign, e.g. games, a competition or events.</p>

              <p class='description'>
                Within this project, the focus is on the application of knowledge gained in HTML, CSS and Javascript. You have to develop an interactive prototype. This could be a website with an easter egg, but it could also be a completely different product. The emphasis should be on development. 

Furthermore, this assignment may be part of the development of resources designed in the media campaign, but it may also be a stand-alone project</p>
